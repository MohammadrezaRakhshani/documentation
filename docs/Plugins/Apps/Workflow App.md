The WeHub Dashboard offers a variety of plugins to enhance and automate your workflows. These plugins are categorized into three types: Triggers, Processors, and Apps. This documentation provides an overview of the "Workflow App" plugin, which falls under the Apps category.

## Workflow App Plugin
The "Workflow App" plugin is used to invoke a workflow app created within the WeHub platform. This plugin provides one action: **Invoke**. Below are the configuration requirements for this action.

### **Action: Invoke**
